In this code repository we provide the Modellus files corresponding to the examples of application discussed in the 
paper. In the blackbody radiation laws subsection 4.1, the files BlackbodyRadiation1.modellus and 
BlackbodyRadiation2.modellus are required to obtain the models in Figures 3 and 4. In the gradient wind velocity 
subsection 4.2, GradientWind.modellus is the file required for Figures 5 and 6.   

We also provide the supplementary material PDF file with the Modellus activity about the gradient wind 
(WindModellusActivity.pdf) and the background image file, required by GradientWind.modellus, that represents an 
idealized mean sea-level pressure distribution chart containing two schematic low pressure and high pressure 
systems (PressureChart.jpg).

To run these models and reproduce the examples in the paper it is necessary to install Modellus. Modellus latest 
version is programmed in Java and is able to run in all operating systems. It is freely available and the 
installation instructions as well as the user manual can be found at the Modellus website 
http://modellus.fct.unl.pt. The installation package includes many sample models and others are regularly added 
to the website which, in addition, contains several other supporting documents and activities. To download the 
pack of Modellus installation files, version 4.01 for Windows or Mac, please register at website. To install follow 
the instructions of the installation wizard.

We thank the Editors and Reviewers of Computers & Geosciences for their valuable comments and suggestions which 
helped us to improve the paper and its resources. In forthcoming versions of Modellus new functionalities will be 
introduced to enhance the development process of computational modelling activities, see Road Map on the Modellus 
website. Such include, for example, the capacity to analyse data which is directly streamed into Modellus from 
sensors, advanced animation objects like curves, waves and fields, and 3D animations and graphs. Other 
enhancements, like 2D and 3D map representations as kindly suggested by one of the Reviewers, may also be added in 
future versions of Modellus, provided adequate funding is available for the programming and testing phases 
involving appropriate adaptation of the Modellus interface window. Please visit our webpage at 
http://modellus.fct.unl.pt for updates. We welcome all suggestions and collaborations that may help us in this 
process. Please send an email directly to us or to modellus@fct.unl.pt .
